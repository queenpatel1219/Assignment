    <dt>What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?</dt>
    <br>
    <dd>
        A Bootstrap Container is a fundamental building block in the Bootstrap framework, used to structure and manage content layout across different devices. It acts like a wrapper for your website's content, providing responsive behavior and a consistent visual framework.
    <br>
    <br>
    .container: This class sets a fixed maximum width for the content at each responsive breakpoint (e.g., small, medium, large screens). It provides margin and padding to give your content breathing room.
    <br>
    .container-fluid: This class makes the container span the entire width of the viewport at all breakpoints. It's good for full-width layouts but has no margins or padding.
    <br>
    .container-{breakpoint}: These classes offer responsive control. For example, .container-sm is 100% width until the small breakpoint, then adapts to predefined max-widths at larger breakpoints.
